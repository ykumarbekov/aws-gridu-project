"I really like this stool. It's sturdy and well-build. Only complaint is that it could be a little wider for me. I like to keep my feet apart somewhat when I nurse.Amusingly, my toddler thinks this is his ""chair"" and uses it when we read books before bed time."|4
I have a little girl and she started using this potty chair at a year old (early, but just to get the concept!)... she has loved it since day one!  She was entertained by the music which was a great incentive for her to stay a little longer on the potty, and when she was ready it transfers and snaps onto the &quot;big girl potty&quot; and still plays music!  She is now two and uses just the big potty but every now and then she still asks for this!  We didn't get much use out of the potty book that comes with it, but it's a cute idea.  All in all this was a good choice for us!|5
I purchased the regular Boppy first. I misunderstood the description and thought it had a removable cover which it doesn't.  It is washable but you put the whole pillow in the washer/dryer. The directions say to dry it with a green tennis ball (strange). I decided to return it and get the Boppy Luxe which does have a removable cover. I like the fabric much better too. It is soft and warm whereas the regular Boppy material is more scratchy.Although I haven't used this product as much as I thought I would, when I have used it it's been great. It's good to remember to use it for those long, sleepy nursing sessions in the evenings. Keep a book by you...I've found I can nurse and read at the same during these long dozzy sessions. Since she's been 3 months old I have occassionally put her in it like a little seat and play with her. She likes this for short periods.|5
I really should've read the reviews on this, but I didn't see how I could go wrong. It's described very well and the pictures really sell it. I think I may have gotten one of the defective ones because the arms that I got did not look like the arms in the instruction booklet. There was not sufficient space and they were too close together in length. Once I put it together, there was no way to fit it onto my table without possibly breaking it or the table. It stuck at a ridiculouly high angle and would not go any further. I hope I have better luck with the next brand I try because I hate the 5' tall rolling highchair that we got as a present. For now, I am content with the bumbo. Amazon is going to take it back as defective and refund me the shipping.|1
I have one under my infant seat and my toddlers harnessed booster. Not only does it prevent the car seat from leaving in imprint in the seat it also catches all of the various crumbs from my toddler. All I have to do is just pull it out and shake it and maybe wipe it down and viola it is ready to be put back in. I also like the little pocket on the bottom that hangs over the seat. In my toddler's one I have an extra toy and a small book, and in my infant's I have an extra set of clothes. I did not have any type of smell on mine.|5
Bought this for my 10 month old, wish I would have gotten at 5 months!  Has helped him find his binky in the middle of the night MUCH better than he could before, and he seems to like to sort of cuddle with it (while sucking the binky) a little bit as we're reading books and settling down before bed.  I like that the clip part doesn't seem to overly obstruct his mouth when he's sleeping.|5
Once you read through the instruction booklet, tying the wrap was really easy to do. And after a couple of practice runs getting my little one in there, it turned out to be really easy to use.  My girl was able to fall asleep while I held her in there which was nice for when we were out and about and even just doing things around the house.  The wide straps allow for maximum comfort and because the fabric stretches out across the shoulders, it helps relieve some of the strain on the back.|5
"After reading all the great reviews and recalling pictures and stories of me carrying around my soft blue ""blankie"" everywhere I went, I thought that it would be great if my little man had a ""comfort object"" too. Well, it arrived and I washed it and excitedly presented it to him. He looked at it, held it for a second and then dropped it to look at a book. I have kept at it- trying to present it to him at different times but he just isn't really taking to it- he's one now so I figure if he were going to take to it he would have by now. The ""blankie"" is little- be sure to look at the size- and the material is just sooo soft. Nice product, just not something my little guy really ever took to."|3
Yes, this record book is very simple and uncomplicated. However it is low quality for the price paid. It looks homemade. But then again the product pictures aren't high quality either. The pages do not turn easily and the first two pages of my book have already ripped.|2
In hindsight, I would not get this item.  I did not return it because, after paying shipping again, you don't get much back.  Simple and to the point? Yes.  But the binding is just a spiral and some of the pages are already coming out.  It's just cheaply made.  I agree that you do need some sort of a book to keep up with medical records, immunizations, etc.  But, there has to be something that is better made.|2
This has saved us! My 2 year old loves it! She really understands the concept. She patiently waits in her room until &#34;Cow Dancing!!!&#34; and then she runs to wake us up. She absolutely loves the dancing cow  and is so excited to tell us every morning that she's dancing. It's great that she wakes up happy. If she wakes up in the middle of the night and asks to read a book or something we can say, when the cow wakes up and dances, then we can read a book - it makes total sense to her. If the cow is sleeping, she needs to sleep.It was a little bit tricky to set up, but not enough for me to give it a 4 star rating.This has given me many hours of extra sleep, helps to teach my child the difference between night and day, and also teaches her patience as she waits for the &#34;Dancing Cow&#34;.Best purchase ever. HIGHLY recommend.|5
I purchased this seat when my Britax seat latch broke and they said it would be two weeks for a replacement part.  I didn't get it on amazon since I needed it right away but love my Amazon family so awaited to share.  This seat is great!  It goes in easy (you tube has a great instructional video, don't read the instruction booklet) and the cup holder is a plus,  it cleans up easy and has a removable mat that can be washed.  I definitely recommend this seat , so does my little man&#34;|4
no potty works well when boys pee, but it works well with the other business. My boy likes sitting there since it's big enough and comfortable enough. He also likes to take out little books and ready them while he is sitting there. But these plastic lids are not study enough.|4
We are very happy with this potty.  It's a great height for our toddler (20 months) to sit on.  We keep a box of toys and books nearby and he will sit and play/read.  It's very easy to empty and clean as well.|5
I purchased the Teethifier along with the Zoli stick gum massagers for my 15 month old, who is cutting his first set of molars. He never used a pacifier, so I wasn't sure how this would work for us. Honestly, he doesn't use either of the back-teeth teethers much, but before bed he'll chew on the Teethifier while we read books, and I leave it with him in his crib. Sometimes I find him chewing on it in the morning. It does make him drool a ton. He has not used the Zoli stick teethers more than a handful of times, and most of the time he turns it around and chews on the non-rubbery end. All in all, if your little one's molars seem to be bothersome, I would recommend the Teethifier.|4
My 37lb 17 month old loves to roll and wiggle when having his diaper changed. I use this pad on our table. It saves my back, and the built in strap keeps my wiggle worm contained. Of course I also give him a book to read too.|5
I bought these for my 10-month-old to help with his teething. At first, he didn't want anything to do with them, but I guess they grew on him because now he looks for them when he needs something to chew on. I don't think the flavoring has anything to do with it, because he will still chew on other teethers, but he does like to gnaw on the head of the dog-shaped teether. If we are sitting still, like reading a book together, I will take one of these teethers and the book so he has something to fiddle with and chew on while we sit. He tends to get fidgety and chew on his fingers if he doesn't have a teether to gnaw on.|5
This was a wonderful investment! I use this bra with both shoulder straps. It stays in place, is comfortable, & I can have my hands free. It's nice to be able to sit & read a book while pumping at work. When finished wearing this, I simply unzip one side & toss it in the laundry. I do dry this in the dryer. You do not have to mess around with readjusting the velcro panels on the back. I recommend purchasing at least 2 of these.|5
When I first saw these, I thought, man, how lazy can you get?? Once I started pumping, I realized that it is not even about convenience. If you're anything over a C, you can't hold the pump in place. You would seriously need 3 arms. It's not like this bra allows you to run a marathon while pumping (I have considered that it would hilarious to use the Medela backpack for this purpose)... But reading a book, sudoku, typing... All options with this bra!|5
I love this bra.  This made my life so much easier when I was pumping.  Before, I made a makeshift bra out of an old sports bra but it often sagged and ended up stretching out and not working any more.  I was able to multi task and catch up on email or read a book or magazine.  The bra was made of a thick material and has really held up good in the wash.  I would recommend this to any mother who plans on pumping.  Definitely worth the price tag.|5
Just like in the picture... you can now read a book, get work done on the computer, or play on your phone. You completely feel like a dairy cow but its so awesome that you end up not even caring!! I feel like I have a wider rib cage so I use the insert and just wrap it tighter.|5
Love this bandeau wrap that frees up both my hands. I have the ameda duo pump and I was getting bored just holding onto the pumps with both hands. Now I can check my emails, read a book or even snack while I pump. No more bored pumping!|5
"I bought this because I had read in a book that it was great for bath time but when I went to use it, the temperature indicator always looked the same. It looks as though it always says ""hot"" even when it's not in water. So I've resorted to using it as an expensive bath toy."|2
It's excellent.  We started using them when she was 8 mos and she would mimic the sounds.The books are short enough, to read over and over for repetition in a single sitting. I likethe material too; they are used at that age when everything goes in the mouth.|4
"My LO loves books- but puts everything in her mouth. These are perfect! We can ""read"" together and she can open and squeeze and put the book ends in her mouth and they hold up very well. She really likes the cube that comes with them too!"|5
This has been a god send to our potty training! My girl feels very secure in sitting there for extended periods of time. this became extremely important as she was very frightened by #2 for quite some time and didn't want to let it loose. So we would sit and read books and this didn't leave marks on her behind and allowed her to get comfortable. I've put a stool under her feet while she's sitting on it and potty training has been a breeze!|5
this book is made of really nice feeling fabrics. the artwork is really cute and has a little squeaky thing inside. we've had this for about a year now (since she was 6mos old) and it's held up nicely though she's barely read it. but good quality and cute all the same, just not very interactive. she hardly picks it up but she still enjoys her books fromManhattan Toy Soft Activity Book with Tethered Toy, Buzzing Throughwhich are more interactive.|4
I hang this from the crib (black and white side out) to keep my little one busy when she is settling down for a nap.  She kicks the rattles and grabs at them.  I prop it in front of her for tummy time to encourage her to reach.  I read it with her like a book and help her pull the shapes out of the holes and taste each one.  And when she's older, she can try putting the shapes in herself.  I love this toy!|5
I purchased the Zoli stick gum massagers along with the Teethifier for my 15 month old, who is cutting his first set of molars. He never used a pacifier, so I wasn't sure how that product would work for us. Honestly, he doesn't use either of the back-teeth teethers much, but before bed he'll chew on the Teethifier while we read books, and I leave it with him in his crib. Sometimes I find him chewing on it in the morning. It does make him drool a ton. He has not used the Zoli stick teethers more than a handful of times, and most of the time he turns it around and chews on the non-rubbery end. I worry that he'll push it too  far into his mouth when using it that way, since the stopper is at the other end. All in all, if your little one's molars seem to be bothersome, I would recommend the Teethifier over these stick teethers.|2
First I want to thank the people that gave tips for installation.  I used them (especially the one about threading the belt back through the seat hole to tighten the chair).  I have a Honda CR-V and the installation was so easy and the car seat is very secure!  This seat is not going anywhere.  My two year old loves it and it looks great too.  I feel so safe with him in this product but it is important to read the book and adjust the straps to your child before you put the chair in the car.  I never would have known to flip the bottom wedge piece to the back for harness installation since it comes out of the box with it ready for booster.  So be sure read the instructions.I am in love with this seat.  Another awesome product by Britax.|5
This is the greatest thing to own while pregnant esp from 2nd trimester. I gave it a four because it lost it's 'cushion' over time. So I still need extra pillows with it. Besides that I love it -it's not as bulky as I hear others can be and does what it is supposed to do. This product seems to have multiple uses -like for instance, I like to shape it into a circle and lean against it while I read a book. I love it -not just for pregnancy but for afterwards too!|4
Since I read other reviews I knew this would not be a good bookend, but i still wanted it so I finally decided to buy. This was bigger than I thought. It's about 7.5 inch. I love how cute this owl is! Looks great in my nursery room! Cute decor item, not so good bookend.|5
Besides being adorable this book makes noises and has plenty of flaps to move.  My 7 month old stay entertained while reading it and I don't have to worry about him ripping pages out.|5
My 4 month old is obsessed with this book! It's been her favorite for about a month now. It holds her attention span when I'm reading but it's been an even better toy. She bear hugs it and chews it and wrestles with it. It's her best buddy. It's weightless so I take it with us everywhere. She loves how it crinkles. Highly recommend.|5
My 14 month old sold loves to play peek-a-boo so this has been a gem of a book.  He giggles throughout and makes me read it over and over and over.  When he was little, he didn't like books or toys that crinkled, but now he likes to smash the book between his hands to hear the sound.|5
My 7 month old loves her Emily doll and this book is a great companion. It's very soft and crinkly and easy to manipulate and Claire loves to explore it! It easily can entertain her for 10-15 minutes at a time and she also enjoys letting me read it to her while lifting and closing the flaps. Well worth the $$$ along with the Emily doll.|5
My 7month old loves this book. I got it for him when he was 5months old and he still is not tired of it. I read it to him about every other day. What fascinates him is all the little flaps with hidden pictures.  I encourage this book to get your lil one into other books. Great buy A++|5
This is a great book for my 6-7 month old. It's soft and crackles and is fun to read! He loves to pull down on the flaps as well so this is a wonderful book and I will probably buy it as a gift for other expecting mothers.|5
It's an easy read. It's great also as there are instructions at the back page how to use the book.|5
Santa put this in my 12month old's stocking and she loves it! I especially love it because she eats the pages of paper books so this one allows us to read without her ingesting paper. Super cute little book, would absolutely recommend and buy again.|5
Cute little soft cover book for the little ones.  Very bright colors and well sewn together.Every other page has the crinkly materials on it in different shapes.The story is kind of predictable... LOL , but it is fun to read and  the Little Ones can chew on it or crinkle it up and make noise.It is worth the price.|5
Our twins (13 months) LOVE this book, since there are cloth flaps that the girls can flip open to see the animals.  We read it to them at least once a day at their request.  I have put it in the washing machine and let it air dry from time to time, and it has turned out great.  So even though the book is a little expensive, I think it's well worth the money.|5
This book is great because it makes plenty of noise (crinkly pages) and is chew friendly for my little one. She loves looking at the colorful pictures/animals and pulling at the pages. She's 7 months old now, but has been enjoying this more than her other books for the past 2 months. Only now is she sitting long enough for me to read it to her.|5
This cloth book was such a HUGE hit with my little girl that I've been desperate to find something she will love just as much.  I haven't yet!  This book has kept her enthralled since she was just 2 1/2 months old.  She figured out how to pull the flaps down, and she still plays with it nearly ever day at 5 months old.  The owl page is a little trickier than the others, but she loves the challenge!  She's starting to understand words a little more and is getting more and more out of this book.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to &#34;read&#34; to their little ones.  The only trouble with it, is she thinks all books have flaps that need to be pulled down now.  So I read regular books to her, and she slaps and claws at the pages searching for the flaps.  ha ha!|5
Well I don;t think a 12 month old or for that matter even a 14 month old will understand or enjoy the story as yet.The story talks about finding the best gift for the princess....so, for a child to understand or for that matter even to sit still while reading lines and lines of story the child has to be gifted ( at 12 months lol)....I think wait until the child turns 2 to buy this book. OR if your child understands the concepts of gifts, roses or peals etc...and has the patience to sit and enjoy while you read and read and read, go ahead:) otherwise save the bucks for a few more months!|3
This book is cute and colorful.  Each page has a peek-a-boo animal from the forest.  The reading is quick and entertaining for an infant.|5
My 2 month old loves this book. The pages are full of bright colors that hold his attention while we read it to him and he loves to make the crinkle pages make noise. Great product!|5
My 10 month old boy/girl twins love this book! They have loved it since they were about 5 months old. Now, they even turn the pages and open the peek-a-boo flaps by themselves. I could read it 1,000 times and that wouldn't be enough for them.And for laughs... The last page reads &#34;Who built this dam? What an achiever! Peek-a-boo, it's the beaver!&#34; My husband and I like to read it like this: &#34;Who built this? DAMN what an achiever! Peek-a-boo, it's the beaver!&#34; Gotta entertain yourselves somehow!|5
"I ordered ""Captain Calamari's Treasure Hunt"" and read it to my 6 month old. She is currently playing with the book now.I am pleased with how large the cloth book is, the feel of the cloth, the rhyming of the sentences and how colorful it is. The mirror and the crackling sounds on the back and cover the book are also major pluses. Having accidentally ordered a book meant for 12 month olds, I am now tempted to order the one meant for 6 month olds."|5
The story is simple and sweet and wonderful.You'll feel happy reading this to your babe.You can get the matching Sir Prance A Lot toy.The vivid colors will peak the interest of your infant.The whole book is lovable.  It's so soft and you can cuddle up close with your babe and read it together.|5
This book is so sweet... Every page has a different secret waiting to be discovered: an owl attached to elastic that can be pulled out, a squeaky mushroom, a crinkly leaf... We &#34;read&#34; it to our little one at bedtime nightly, and he loves it.|5
My toddler enjoys sitting in this chair to watch a show or read her books. It stains very easy and isn't the best quality, but it's a good price. The fabric is very soft and almost feels like a shirt. In some places, the fabric is a little too stretched out to cover the chair. Still a good buy, but if you're looking for a piece to invest in for many years, this is not it.|3
I was nervous at first to use these reading all the books about cutting your newborns flesh, but it is virtually impossible with these!|5
This book has a lot of detail!!! I love it. From birth to 5 years (1-5 years is like 1 to 2 pages only) The first year has most of the pages. I would suggest reading the book and what the pages ask about 'firsts' because there are a lot of misc. things I never thought to record! :o) Also the pages are so adorable with the animals.|5
Be ready because this book asks about month milestones and yearly one, family history and marriage of parents and grandparent sand firsts and dental checkups and doctor checkups too. It is a bit too much for me and now I fill obligated to fill in every space.... not so good.|3
I love this wallet.  I have never had one tha is long like a checkbook, but am loving it already.  It fits everything in it I need, including 2 clear slots for pictures and a clear slot for your drivers license.  There is a slot for cash to hold it length wise as well, which is great, so it doesn't get all wadded up in your wallet.  Great purchase if you just want everything in one place and you can throw it in a black purse any time to match.  I just quit carrying a purse all together with having a newborn around.|5
"Having a 2 year old I've seen many pottys on the market.  What I LOVE about this one is you can put TP in one section and books in the other. It is VERY easy to slide the ""bowl"" in and out and to clean. I am SOOOOO glad that I spent a few more dollars and got this potty.  I also like tha it can serve as a stool when she is ready to get on the bigger potty.  Which we have been using it for lately and it's been great."|5
We have quite a few Lamaze toys, and although this elephant turned out to be not as popular as the dragon fly, the book was an absolute hit... she loved to read and play with it until it eventually fell apart (not really due to lack of quality, a book binding can only take so much!).|4
"This book came when our little guy was 7 weeks old.  He loved it right away. Of all of his books, this one has held his attention the best.  He loves to stare at it during tummy time, and he laughs when we ""read"" it to him."|5
Wow. This potty seat is perfect for my curious 18 month old. It's soft-ish and comfy, stays on the toilet nicely, is a wonderful shape that helps him feel secure and blocks pee from splattering all over the place. It's easy to rinse and store. He can just sit up in his little throne, with his feet dangling, and read a book or watch my iPad while he tries to figure out which muscle groups to use while he perches. Kudos to the designers of this one.|5
It is very comfortable and soft to sit on. My boy loves sitting there and reading books just for fun.|5
When I first got these I wasn't ready to install the car seat yet so I left them in their packaging. Big mistake! When you first get these I highly recommend taking them out and letting them flatten, even laying them under some books if you need to. Since I did not do this one of the shades is bent on the edge and so it doesn't lay perfectly flat against the window. This means I can sometimes get it to stick and others it slowly peels itself off and falls to the floor. The style of these is very clever I just wish it was packaged better so that it couldn't get messed up. I have found it is easiest to apply them when they are warm so let them sit in a hot car for a bit before doing it, or if it's a cold month maybe warm them up with a hair dryer first? Overall I might go with another brand one day, but these do work once they're on the windows!|3
We have a small nursery and wanted to get a recliner but just couldn't fit one.  This chair works great!  It's super comfortable for sitting and reading a book, nursing or giving a bottle.  My husband and I both enjoy it.  We bought a small nursing stool to go with it.  I was worried at first about not having a headrest, but I don't want to fall asleep when I'm nursing anyways!  The amazon price is great (especially if you use your registry discount) and the grey color is nice and neutral.|5
These books are incredibly cute, impressively comprehensive, and make record keeping easy and fun.  Make sure you order it well before your due date so you can fill in some of the information in advance and also so you can have it ready for getting hand and footprints after delivery.|5
I had read all of the reviews for this product and the ones similar.  There are many on Amazon that look identical - please watch the measurements.  I think a lot of the negative reviews are from people who didnt watch that.  I wanted a smaller sturdy organizer that I could use for a road trip with my little one.  This is exactly what I got.  Big enough for a couple toys, books, snacks....thats all I needed.  This is perfect.  I like that it has the little grippy type stuff on the bottom too so it wont be as prone to slide on leather seats.|5
I use this item multiple times everyday and it makes my life much easier. I can browse the computer or read a book while pumping. It's still in very good quality after multiple washes. I would highly recommend this if you pump a lot.|5
My little one was scared to sleep in her new twin bed instead of the crib. It was more open, just uncomfortable for her. I got her this light and suddenly she loves her big girl bed! She has &#34;Mr. Owl&#34; to make her feel safe and she can see her books as she reads herself to sleep. He's bright enough but not too bright, easy to carry, easy to push button... he is worth every penny! He shuts off automatically after 20 minutes so I don't have to worry about going back in her room later to turn him off. Simply fantastic!|5
"This backpack with safety harness is well-built, attrctive, and great for toddlers, but they will quickly outgrow it. It's even too small for my three-year-old. So when you see it says ""18 months and older,"" don't expect this to still be in use to carry books to school.The size also limits its appeal because how many toddlers do you know who walk everywhere? My little boys are quite fit and energetic, but motivating them to walk any significant distance is like pulling teeth. So I question just how much use they would get out of this backpack even if they weren't already too large for them.All said, this is a great product for active families with a toddler or two. I'm taking one star off to account for the fact that it will quickly be outgrown."|4
Well constructed and she thinks it's great fun to play in, read books, etc.  Our cat enjoys sitting in  it.  However, it has yet to serve it's intended purpose of sleep.  We've tried multiple times to get her to nap in it and generally she talks to herself for about 30 minutes, cries, cries louder, we take her out and put her in her crib and she falls right to sleep.|3
This Britax appears to be the most comfortable and safety geared seat on the market at this time.Instruction booklet and videos on line assist in installation and adjustment.The ability to use rear and forward facing positions is always a plus.It is anticipated that our little one will be transported safely over the suggested weight and height periods.Did have a question and called Britax...the seat is large and we wanted to make certain of some aspects...After 16 plus minutes on hold...we gave up.  One has much better guidance by rereading and watching videos thoroughly.|5
"After reading a lot of hype about this, I caved and bought it. I can't believe that I spent so much money on a product that actually frustrates the heck out of my skin. If you have sensitive skin which is prone to breakouts, I couldn't recommend this in good faith. You know those exfoliants you can get at any drug store that have the plastic/synthetic ""microbead"" things? If you skin doesn't react well to those kinds of products, this might break you out as it did me. Little tiny bumps everywhere, not a pretty sight. If you have resilient, normal skin I can imagine that this would sort of buff it nicely. Sensitive skin? Too harsh in my book."|1
After doing lots of research I finally ordered this.  I was nervous that I would not get an authentic product but this is good and the real deal.  It comes with booklet, cleaner, and an extra steam cartilage.  I ordered the one with steam. I haven't used the steam feature and I don't think I need to. I wanted loose curls so I used the low setting and 8 seconds.  I sectioned my hair and when I came to front I switched from alternate setting to where it's away from my face. I had to use my hands and open curls up a bit and used some argon oil too.  Overall it's a great product and it does exactly what it says.  If you are good with curling rod then you don't need this.  My curls lasted for 3 days.  I only got my hair stuck in once and that's because I put too much hair and didn't comb and smooth it out first.  You should read instruction book and lots of u tube tutorials on this.  Happy curling|5
Perfect OEM.  ONE WORD OF WARNING, if you are not good at soldering and/or you don't have a good iron, don't try this yourself.  The contacts are very thin and will burn up in a hurry.  I recomend readingThe Fender Stratocaster Handbook: How To Buy, Maintain, Set Up, Troubleshoot, and Modify Your Stratif you are unsure.|5
The other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built. They were right. It can be adjusted to a number of different heights to suit your particular needs - and based on the design of the stand it will stay where it's put. One of the best parts is that while it is stable enough to be the main foot rest where I play my guitar it can be collapsed flat and it easily fits into a bag or backpack - probably around half of the thickness of a chord book, although heavier, as it is steel with a rubber tread on top. It feels like I will own this for a long time - a well priced, good value.Edit2/2013After owning this for around a year and using it every day I find that it still looks and works like new. I recommend it highly.|5
I read the reviews with low stars, the major complaints are squeaking sound when you twist the head. We use it to hold the musics and don't need to turn the head. The heads of music stands on stage are fixed too, if they turned, they could not fit into the music stand rack. This one work great for us.We have several music stands,  we didn't like them not because the heads can't be turned but they are unstable and can't hold thick book.|5
It fits my acoustic well while giving minimum protection.Storage compartment could be larger, but good for extra strings and picks.You can&#8217;t fit a full sheet of paper or an 8.5&#8221; x 11&#8221;paper back guitar book in the zipper compartment.I would be careful of putting anything in the zipper compartment that could damage the guitarCross straps work well for carrying. Zipper system works well.It is a nice acoustic guitar bag for an inexpensive guitar considering the price.It fits my Jasmine ES31C Dreadnought Acoustic-Electric Guitar just fine.You really can't beat it for the price.|4
Not really bright enough. Both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same.  I would look for something else if I didn't already have this.  OK for reading a small book in bed, but doesn't cover the sheet music brightly enough.|2
"I really like this stool. It's sturdy and well-build. Only complaint is that it could be a little wider for me. I like to keep my feet apart somewhat when I nurse.Amusingly, my toddler thinks this is his ""chair"" and uses it when we read books before bed time."|4
I have a little girl and she started using this potty chair at a year old (early, but just to get the concept!)... she has loved it since day one!  She was entertained by the music which was a great incentive for her to stay a little longer on the potty, and when she was ready it transfers and snaps onto the &quot;big girl potty&quot; and still plays music!  She is now two and uses just the big potty but every now and then she still asks for this!  We didn't get much use out of the potty book that comes with it, but it's a cute idea.  All in all this was a good choice for us!|5
I purchased the regular Boppy first. I misunderstood the description and thought it had a removable cover which it doesn't.  It is washable but you put the whole pillow in the washer/dryer. The directions say to dry it with a green tennis ball (strange). I decided to return it and get the Boppy Luxe which does have a removable cover. I like the fabric much better too. It is soft and warm whereas the regular Boppy material is more scratchy.Although I haven't used this product as much as I thought I would, when I have used it it's been great. It's good to remember to use it for those long, sleepy nursing sessions in the evenings. Keep a book by you...I've found I can nurse and read at the same during these long dozzy sessions. Since she's been 3 months old I have occassionally put her in it like a little seat and play with her. She likes this for short periods.|5
I really should've read the reviews on this, but I didn't see how I could go wrong. It's described very well and the pictures really sell it. I think I may have gotten one of the defective ones because the arms that I got did not look like the arms in the instruction booklet. There was not sufficient space and they were too close together in length. Once I put it together, there was no way to fit it onto my table without possibly breaking it or the table. It stuck at a ridiculouly high angle and would not go any further. I hope I have better luck with the next brand I try because I hate the 5' tall rolling highchair that we got as a present. For now, I am content with the bumbo. Amazon is going to take it back as defective and refund me the shipping.|1
I have one under my infant seat and my toddlers harnessed booster. Not only does it prevent the car seat from leaving in imprint in the seat it also catches all of the various crumbs from my toddler. All I have to do is just pull it out and shake it and maybe wipe it down and viola it is ready to be put back in. I also like the little pocket on the bottom that hangs over the seat. In my toddler's one I have an extra toy and a small book, and in my infant's I have an extra set of clothes. I did not have any type of smell on mine.|5
Bought this for my 10 month old, wish I would have gotten at 5 months!  Has helped him find his binky in the middle of the night MUCH better than he could before, and he seems to like to sort of cuddle with it (while sucking the binky) a little bit as we're reading books and settling down before bed.  I like that the clip part doesn't seem to overly obstruct his mouth when he's sleeping.|5
Once you read through the instruction booklet, tying the wrap was really easy to do. And after a couple of practice runs getting my little one in there, it turned out to be really easy to use.  My girl was able to fall asleep while I held her in there which was nice for when we were out and about and even just doing things around the house.  The wide straps allow for maximum comfort and because the fabric stretches out across the shoulders, it helps relieve some of the strain on the back.|5
"After reading all the great reviews and recalling pictures and stories of me carrying around my soft blue ""blankie"" everywhere I went, I thought that it would be great if my little man had a ""comfort object"" too. Well, it arrived and I washed it and excitedly presented it to him. He looked at it, held it for a second and then dropped it to look at a book. I have kept at it- trying to present it to him at different times but he just isn't really taking to it- he's one now so I figure if he were going to take to it he would have by now. The ""blankie"" is little- be sure to look at the size- and the material is just sooo soft. Nice product, just not something my little guy really ever took to."|3
Yes, this record book is very simple and uncomplicated. However it is low quality for the price paid. It looks homemade. But then again the product pictures aren't high quality either. The pages do not turn easily and the first two pages of my book have already ripped.|2
In hindsight, I would not get this item.  I did not return it because, after paying shipping again, you don't get much back.  Simple and to the point? Yes.  But the binding is just a spiral and some of the pages are already coming out.  It's just cheaply made.  I agree that you do need some sort of a book to keep up with medical records, immunizations, etc.  But, there has to be something that is better made.|2
This has saved us! My 2 year old loves it! She really understands the concept. She patiently waits in her room until &#34;Cow Dancing!!!&#34; and then she runs to wake us up. She absolutely loves the dancing cow  and is so excited to tell us every morning that she's dancing. It's great that she wakes up happy. If she wakes up in the middle of the night and asks to read a book or something we can say, when the cow wakes up and dances, then we can read a book - it makes total sense to her. If the cow is sleeping, she needs to sleep.It was a little bit tricky to set up, but not enough for me to give it a 4 star rating.This has given me many hours of extra sleep, helps to teach my child the difference between night and day, and also teaches her patience as she waits for the &#34;Dancing Cow&#34;.Best purchase ever. HIGHLY recommend.|5
I purchased this seat when my Britax seat latch broke and they said it would be two weeks for a replacement part.  I didn't get it on amazon since I needed it right away but love my Amazon family so awaited to share.  This seat is great!  It goes in easy (you tube has a great instructional video, don't read the instruction booklet) and the cup holder is a plus,  it cleans up easy and has a removable mat that can be washed.  I definitely recommend this seat , so does my little man&#34;|4
no potty works well when boys pee, but it works well with the other business. My boy likes sitting there since it's big enough and comfortable enough. He also likes to take out little books and ready them while he is sitting there. But these plastic lids are not study enough.|4
We are very happy with this potty.  It's a great height for our toddler (20 months) to sit on.  We keep a box of toys and books nearby and he will sit and play/read.  It's very easy to empty and clean as well.|5
I purchased the Teethifier along with the Zoli stick gum massagers for my 15 month old, who is cutting his first set of molars. He never used a pacifier, so I wasn't sure how this would work for us. Honestly, he doesn't use either of the back-teeth teethers much, but before bed he'll chew on the Teethifier while we read books, and I leave it with him in his crib. Sometimes I find him chewing on it in the morning. It does make him drool a ton. He has not used the Zoli stick teethers more than a handful of times, and most of the time he turns it around and chews on the non-rubbery end. All in all, if your little one's molars seem to be bothersome, I would recommend the Teethifier.|4
My 37lb 17 month old loves to roll and wiggle when having his diaper changed. I use this pad on our table. It saves my back, and the built in strap keeps my wiggle worm contained. Of course I also give him a book to read too.|5
I bought these for my 10-month-old to help with his teething. At first, he didn't want anything to do with them, but I guess they grew on him because now he looks for them when he needs something to chew on. I don't think the flavoring has anything to do with it, because he will still chew on other teethers, but he does like to gnaw on the head of the dog-shaped teether. If we are sitting still, like reading a book together, I will take one of these teethers and the book so he has something to fiddle with and chew on while we sit. He tends to get fidgety and chew on his fingers if he doesn't have a teether to gnaw on.|5
This was a wonderful investment! I use this bra with both shoulder straps. It stays in place, is comfortable, & I can have my hands free. It's nice to be able to sit & read a book while pumping at work. When finished wearing this, I simply unzip one side & toss it in the laundry. I do dry this in the dryer. You do not have to mess around with readjusting the velcro panels on the back. I recommend purchasing at least 2 of these.|5
When I first saw these, I thought, man, how lazy can you get?? Once I started pumping, I realized that it is not even about convenience. If you're anything over a C, you can't hold the pump in place. You would seriously need 3 arms. It's not like this bra allows you to run a marathon while pumping (I have considered that it would hilarious to use the Medela backpack for this purpose)... But reading a book, sudoku, typing... All options with this bra!|5
I love this bra.  This made my life so much easier when I was pumping.  Before, I made a makeshift bra out of an old sports bra but it often sagged and ended up stretching out and not working any more.  I was able to multi task and catch up on email or read a book or magazine.  The bra was made of a thick material and has really held up good in the wash.  I would recommend this to any mother who plans on pumping.  Definitely worth the price tag.|5
Just like in the picture... you can now read a book, get work done on the computer, or play on your phone. You completely feel like a dairy cow but its so awesome that you end up not even caring!! I feel like I have a wider rib cage so I use the insert and just wrap it tighter.|5
Love this bandeau wrap that frees up both my hands. I have the ameda duo pump and I was getting bored just holding onto the pumps with both hands. Now I can check my emails, read a book or even snack while I pump. No more bored pumping!|5
"I bought this because I had read in a book that it was great for bath time but when I went to use it, the temperature indicator always looked the same. It looks as though it always says ""hot"" even when it's not in water. So I've resorted to using it as an expensive bath toy."|2
It's excellent.  We started using them when she was 8 mos and she would mimic the sounds.The books are short enough, to read over and over for repetition in a single sitting. I likethe material too; they are used at that age when everything goes in the mouth.|4
"My LO loves books- but puts everything in her mouth. These are perfect! We can ""read"" together and she can open and squeeze and put the book ends in her mouth and they hold up very well. She really likes the cube that comes with them too!"|5
This has been a god send to our potty training! My girl feels very secure in sitting there for extended periods of time. this became extremely important as she was very frightened by #2 for quite some time and didn't want to let it loose. So we would sit and read books and this didn't leave marks on her behind and allowed her to get comfortable. I've put a stool under her feet while she's sitting on it and potty training has been a breeze!|5
this book is made of really nice feeling fabrics. the artwork is really cute and has a little squeaky thing inside. we've had this for about a year now (since she was 6mos old) and it's held up nicely though she's barely read it. but good quality and cute all the same, just not very interactive. she hardly picks it up but she still enjoys her books fromManhattan Toy Soft Activity Book with Tethered Toy, Buzzing Throughwhich are more interactive.|4
I hang this from the crib (black and white side out) to keep my little one busy when she is settling down for a nap.  She kicks the rattles and grabs at them.  I prop it in front of her for tummy time to encourage her to reach.  I read it with her like a book and help her pull the shapes out of the holes and taste each one.  And when she's older, she can try putting the shapes in herself.  I love this toy!|5
I purchased the Zoli stick gum massagers along with the Teethifier for my 15 month old, who is cutting his first set of molars. He never used a pacifier, so I wasn't sure how that product would work for us. Honestly, he doesn't use either of the back-teeth teethers much, but before bed he'll chew on the Teethifier while we read books, and I leave it with him in his crib. Sometimes I find him chewing on it in the morning. It does make him drool a ton. He has not used the Zoli stick teethers more than a handful of times, and most of the time he turns it around and chews on the non-rubbery end. I worry that he'll push it too  far into his mouth when using it that way, since the stopper is at the other end. All in all, if your little one's molars seem to be bothersome, I would recommend the Teethifier over these stick teethers.|2
First I want to thank the people that gave tips for installation.  I used them (especially the one about threading the belt back through the seat hole to tighten the chair).  I have a Honda CR-V and the installation was so easy and the car seat is very secure!  This seat is not going anywhere.  My two year old loves it and it looks great too.  I feel so safe with him in this product but it is important to read the book and adjust the straps to your child before you put the chair in the car.  I never would have known to flip the bottom wedge piece to the back for harness installation since it comes out of the box with it ready for booster.  So be sure read the instructions.I am in love with this seat.  Another awesome product by Britax.|5
This is the greatest thing to own while pregnant esp from 2nd trimester. I gave it a four because it lost it's 'cushion' over time. So I still need extra pillows with it. Besides that I love it -it's not as bulky as I hear others can be and does what it is supposed to do. This product seems to have multiple uses -like for instance, I like to shape it into a circle and lean against it while I read a book. I love it -not just for pregnancy but for afterwards too!|4
Since I read other reviews I knew this would not be a good bookend, but i still wanted it so I finally decided to buy. This was bigger than I thought. It's about 7.5 inch. I love how cute this owl is! Looks great in my nursery room! Cute decor item, not so good bookend.|5
Besides being adorable this book makes noises and has plenty of flaps to move.  My 7 month old stay entertained while reading it and I don't have to worry about him ripping pages out.|5
My 4 month old is obsessed with this book! It's been her favorite for about a month now. It holds her attention span when I'm reading but it's been an even better toy. She bear hugs it and chews it and wrestles with it. It's her best buddy. It's weightless so I take it with us everywhere. She loves how it crinkles. Highly recommend.|5
My 14 month old sold loves to play peek-a-boo so this has been a gem of a book.  He giggles throughout and makes me read it over and over and over.  When he was little, he didn't like books or toys that crinkled, but now he likes to smash the book between his hands to hear the sound.|5
My 7 month old loves her Emily doll and this book is a great companion. It's very soft and crinkly and easy to manipulate and Claire loves to explore it! It easily can entertain her for 10-15 minutes at a time and she also enjoys letting me read it to her while lifting and closing the flaps. Well worth the $$$ along with the Emily doll.|5
My 7month old loves this book. I got it for him when he was 5months old and he still is not tired of it. I read it to him about every other day. What fascinates him is all the little flaps with hidden pictures.  I encourage this book to get your lil one into other books. Great buy A++|5
This is a great book for my 6-7 month old. It's soft and crackles and is fun to read! He loves to pull down on the flaps as well so this is a wonderful book and I will probably buy it as a gift for other expecting mothers.|5
It's an easy read. It's great also as there are instructions at the back page how to use the book.|5
Santa put this in my 12month old's stocking and she loves it! I especially love it because she eats the pages of paper books so this one allows us to read without her ingesting paper. Super cute little book, would absolutely recommend and buy again.|5
Cute little soft cover book for the little ones.  Very bright colors and well sewn together.Every other page has the crinkly materials on it in different shapes.The story is kind of predictable... LOL , but it is fun to read and  the Little Ones can chew on it or crinkle it up and make noise.It is worth the price.|5
Our twins (13 months) LOVE this book, since there are cloth flaps that the girls can flip open to see the animals.  We read it to them at least once a day at their request.  I have put it in the washing machine and let it air dry from time to time, and it has turned out great.  So even though the book is a little expensive, I think it's well worth the money.|5
This book is great because it makes plenty of noise (crinkly pages) and is chew friendly for my little one. She loves looking at the colorful pictures/animals and pulling at the pages. She's 7 months old now, but has been enjoying this more than her other books for the past 2 months. Only now is she sitting long enough for me to read it to her.|5
This cloth book was such a HUGE hit with my little girl that I've been desperate to find something she will love just as much.  I haven't yet!  This book has kept her enthralled since she was just 2 1/2 months old.  She figured out how to pull the flaps down, and she still plays with it nearly ever day at 5 months old.  The owl page is a little trickier than the others, but she loves the challenge!  She's starting to understand words a little more and is getting more and more out of this book.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to &#34;read&#34; to their little ones.  The only trouble with it, is she thinks all books have flaps that need to be pulled down now.  So I read regular books to her, and she slaps and claws at the pages searching for the flaps.  ha ha!|5
Well I don;t think a 12 month old or for that matter even a 14 month old will understand or enjoy the story as yet.The story talks about finding the best gift for the princess....so, for a child to understand or for that matter even to sit still while reading lines and lines of story the child has to be gifted ( at 12 months lol)....I think wait until the child turns 2 to buy this book. OR if your child understands the concepts of gifts, roses or peals etc...and has the patience to sit and enjoy while you read and read and read, go ahead:) otherwise save the bucks for a few more months!|3
This book is cute and colorful.  Each page has a peek-a-boo animal from the forest.  The reading is quick and entertaining for an infant.|5
My 2 month old loves this book. The pages are full of bright colors that hold his attention while we read it to him and he loves to make the crinkle pages make noise. Great product!|5
My 10 month old boy/girl twins love this book! They have loved it since they were about 5 months old. Now, they even turn the pages and open the peek-a-boo flaps by themselves. I could read it 1,000 times and that wouldn't be enough for them.And for laughs... The last page reads &#34;Who built this dam? What an achiever! Peek-a-boo, it's the beaver!&#34; My husband and I like to read it like this: &#34;Who built this? DAMN what an achiever! Peek-a-boo, it's the beaver!&#34; Gotta entertain yourselves somehow!|5
"I ordered ""Captain Calamari's Treasure Hunt"" and read it to my 6 month old. She is currently playing with the book now.I am pleased with how large the cloth book is, the feel of the cloth, the rhyming of the sentences and how colorful it is. The mirror and the crackling sounds on the back and cover the book are also major pluses. Having accidentally ordered a book meant for 12 month olds, I am now tempted to order the one meant for 6 month olds."|5
The story is simple and sweet and wonderful.You'll feel happy reading this to your babe.You can get the matching Sir Prance A Lot toy.The vivid colors will peak the interest of your infant.The whole book is lovable.  It's so soft and you can cuddle up close with your babe and read it together.|5
This book is so sweet... Every page has a different secret waiting to be discovered: an owl attached to elastic that can be pulled out, a squeaky mushroom, a crinkly leaf... We &#34;read&#34; it to our little one at bedtime nightly, and he loves it.|5
My toddler enjoys sitting in this chair to watch a show or read her books. It stains very easy and isn't the best quality, but it's a good price. The fabric is very soft and almost feels like a shirt. In some places, the fabric is a little too stretched out to cover the chair. Still a good buy, but if you're looking for a piece to invest in for many years, this is not it.|3
I was nervous at first to use these reading all the books about cutting your newborns flesh, but it is virtually impossible with these!|5
This book has a lot of detail!!! I love it. From birth to 5 years (1-5 years is like 1 to 2 pages only) The first year has most of the pages. I would suggest reading the book and what the pages ask about 'firsts' because there are a lot of misc. things I never thought to record! :o) Also the pages are so adorable with the animals.|5
Be ready because this book asks about month milestones and yearly one, family history and marriage of parents and grandparent sand firsts and dental checkups and doctor checkups too. It is a bit too much for me and now I fill obligated to fill in every space.... not so good.|3
I love this wallet.  I have never had one tha is long like a checkbook, but am loving it already.  It fits everything in it I need, including 2 clear slots for pictures and a clear slot for your drivers license.  There is a slot for cash to hold it length wise as well, which is great, so it doesn't get all wadded up in your wallet.  Great purchase if you just want everything in one place and you can throw it in a black purse any time to match.  I just quit carrying a purse all together with having a newborn around.|5
"Having a 2 year old I've seen many pottys on the market.  What I LOVE about this one is you can put TP in one section and books in the other. It is VERY easy to slide the ""bowl"" in and out and to clean. I am SOOOOO glad that I spent a few more dollars and got this potty.  I also like tha it can serve as a stool when she is ready to get on the bigger potty.  Which we have been using it for lately and it's been great."|5
We have quite a few Lamaze toys, and although this elephant turned out to be not as popular as the dragon fly, the book was an absolute hit... she loved to read and play with it until it eventually fell apart (not really due to lack of quality, a book binding can only take so much!).|4
"This book came when our little guy was 7 weeks old.  He loved it right away. Of all of his books, this one has held his attention the best.  He loves to stare at it during tummy time, and he laughs when we ""read"" it to him."|5
Wow. This potty seat is perfect for my curious 18 month old. It's soft-ish and comfy, stays on the toilet nicely, is a wonderful shape that helps him feel secure and blocks pee from splattering all over the place. It's easy to rinse and store. He can just sit up in his little throne, with his feet dangling, and read a book or watch my iPad while he tries to figure out which muscle groups to use while he perches. Kudos to the designers of this one.|5
It is very comfortable and soft to sit on. My boy loves sitting there and reading books just for fun.|5
When I first got these I wasn't ready to install the car seat yet so I left them in their packaging. Big mistake! When you first get these I highly recommend taking them out and letting them flatten, even laying them under some books if you need to. Since I did not do this one of the shades is bent on the edge and so it doesn't lay perfectly flat against the window. This means I can sometimes get it to stick and others it slowly peels itself off and falls to the floor. The style of these is very clever I just wish it was packaged better so that it couldn't get messed up. I have found it is easiest to apply them when they are warm so let them sit in a hot car for a bit before doing it, or if it's a cold month maybe warm them up with a hair dryer first? Overall I might go with another brand one day, but these do work once they're on the windows!|3
We have a small nursery and wanted to get a recliner but just couldn't fit one.  This chair works great!  It's super comfortable for sitting and reading a book, nursing or giving a bottle.  My husband and I both enjoy it.  We bought a small nursing stool to go with it.  I was worried at first about not having a headrest, but I don't want to fall asleep when I'm nursing anyways!  The amazon price is great (especially if you use your registry discount) and the grey color is nice and neutral.|5
These books are incredibly cute, impressively comprehensive, and make record keeping easy and fun.  Make sure you order it well before your due date so you can fill in some of the information in advance and also so you can have it ready for getting hand and footprints after delivery.|5
I had read all of the reviews for this product and the ones similar.  There are many on Amazon that look identical - please watch the measurements.  I think a lot of the negative reviews are from people who didnt watch that.  I wanted a smaller sturdy organizer that I could use for a road trip with my little one.  This is exactly what I got.  Big enough for a couple toys, books, snacks....thats all I needed.  This is perfect.  I like that it has the little grippy type stuff on the bottom too so it wont be as prone to slide on leather seats.|5
I use this item multiple times everyday and it makes my life much easier. I can browse the computer or read a book while pumping. It's still in very good quality after multiple washes. I would highly recommend this if you pump a lot.|5
My little one was scared to sleep in her new twin bed instead of the crib. It was more open, just uncomfortable for her. I got her this light and suddenly she loves her big girl bed! She has &#34;Mr. Owl&#34; to make her feel safe and she can see her books as she reads herself to sleep. He's bright enough but not too bright, easy to carry, easy to push button... he is worth every penny! He shuts off automatically after 20 minutes so I don't have to worry about going back in her room later to turn him off. Simply fantastic!|5
"This backpack with safety harness is well-built, attrctive, and great for toddlers, but they will quickly outgrow it. It's even too small for my three-year-old. So when you see it says ""18 months and older,"" don't expect this to still be in use to carry books to school.The size also limits its appeal because how many toddlers do you know who walk everywhere? My little boys are quite fit and energetic, but motivating them to walk any significant distance is like pulling teeth. So I question just how much use they would get out of this backpack even if they weren't already too large for them.All said, this is a great product for active families with a toddler or two. I'm taking one star off to account for the fact that it will quickly be outgrown."|4
Well constructed and she thinks it's great fun to play in, read books, etc.  Our cat enjoys sitting in  it.  However, it has yet to serve it's intended purpose of sleep.  We've tried multiple times to get her to nap in it and generally she talks to herself for about 30 minutes, cries, cries louder, we take her out and put her in her crib and she falls right to sleep.|3
This Britax appears to be the most comfortable and safety geared seat on the market at this time.Instruction booklet and videos on line assist in installation and adjustment.The ability to use rear and forward facing positions is always a plus.It is anticipated that our little one will be transported safely over the suggested weight and height periods.Did have a question and called Britax...the seat is large and we wanted to make certain of some aspects...After 16 plus minutes on hold...we gave up.  One has much better guidance by rereading and watching videos thoroughly.|5
"After reading a lot of hype about this, I caved and bought it. I can't believe that I spent so much money on a product that actually frustrates the heck out of my skin. If you have sensitive skin which is prone to breakouts, I couldn't recommend this in good faith. You know those exfoliants you can get at any drug store that have the plastic/synthetic ""microbead"" things? If you skin doesn't react well to those kinds of products, this might break you out as it did me. Little tiny bumps everywhere, not a pretty sight. If you have resilient, normal skin I can imagine that this would sort of buff it nicely. Sensitive skin? Too harsh in my book."|1
After doing lots of research I finally ordered this.  I was nervous that I would not get an authentic product but this is good and the real deal.  It comes with booklet, cleaner, and an extra steam cartilage.  I ordered the one with steam. I haven't used the steam feature and I don't think I need to. I wanted loose curls so I used the low setting and 8 seconds.  I sectioned my hair and when I came to front I switched from alternate setting to where it's away from my face. I had to use my hands and open curls up a bit and used some argon oil too.  Overall it's a great product and it does exactly what it says.  If you are good with curling rod then you don't need this.  My curls lasted for 3 days.  I only got my hair stuck in once and that's because I put too much hair and didn't comb and smooth it out first.  You should read instruction book and lots of u tube tutorials on this.  Happy curling|5
Perfect OEM.  ONE WORD OF WARNING, if you are not good at soldering and/or you don't have a good iron, don't try this yourself.  The contacts are very thin and will burn up in a hurry.  I recomend readingThe Fender Stratocaster Handbook: How To Buy, Maintain, Set Up, Troubleshoot, and Modify Your Stratif you are unsure.|5
The other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built. They were right. It can be adjusted to a number of different heights to suit your particular needs - and based on the design of the stand it will stay where it's put. One of the best parts is that while it is stable enough to be the main foot rest where I play my guitar it can be collapsed flat and it easily fits into a bag or backpack - probably around half of the thickness of a chord book, although heavier, as it is steel with a rubber tread on top. It feels like I will own this for a long time - a well priced, good value.Edit2/2013After owning this for around a year and using it every day I find that it still looks and works like new. I recommend it highly.|5
I read the reviews with low stars, the major complaints are squeaking sound when you twist the head. We use it to hold the musics and don't need to turn the head. The heads of music stands on stage are fixed too, if they turned, they could not fit into the music stand rack. This one work great for us.We have several music stands,  we didn't like them not because the heads can't be turned but they are unstable and can't hold thick book.|5
It fits my acoustic well while giving minimum protection.Storage compartment could be larger, but good for extra strings and picks.You can&#8217;t fit a full sheet of paper or an 8.5&#8221; x 11&#8221;paper back guitar book in the zipper compartment.I would be careful of putting anything in the zipper compartment that could damage the guitarCross straps work well for carrying. Zipper system works well.It is a nice acoustic guitar bag for an inexpensive guitar considering the price.It fits my Jasmine ES31C Dreadnought Acoustic-Electric Guitar just fine.You really can't beat it for the price.|4
Not really bright enough. Both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same.  I would look for something else if I didn't already have this.  OK for reading a small book in bed, but doesn't cover the sheet music brightly enough.|2
